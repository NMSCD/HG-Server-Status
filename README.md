# ðŸ“ˆ HG server Status

This site allows you to see the status of the servers that the **NMSCD** and the **NMS API reverse engineering** are tracking. This project does not add any additional pings per minute to the HG infrastructure, it merely uses the already gathered information that the [AssistantNMS](https://nmsassistant.com) servers have already gathered while keeping the endpoints that are checked _secret_.
